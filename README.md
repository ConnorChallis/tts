This is a text to speech emulator powered by Streamlabs' unofficial API. It converts your text to speech with any of Streamlab's voices. The frontend is completely static, backend is powered by serverless Node.js Lambda functions.

[Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com) is a live streaming software based on [OBS (Open Broadcast Software)](https://obsproject.com).
